###This is a list of stuff I want to do soon.

* 3D Printer([Kossel Mini][kossel])
* [Hexapod Robot][hex]
* [Kiwi/Honolomic Drive Robot][hex]
  * I also want to make a couple of these with thumbtacks and balloons so they can battle
* Knifemaking -- Check out how [Hackett][hackett] and [Will from Storm The Castle][stc] did it
* Music Production -- Using FOSS software, such as Ardour
* Drift Trike -- design similar to [this no-weld design][drift]
	* Possibly Motorized - 450W motor
* Custom Mechanical Keyboard
	* 40Percenters

###These are some things I have done recently


* colorizer -- takes an image and creates a gif of the image going from 0 to 100% saturation -- may be uploaded soon
* pages-pdf -- makes a pdf out of an Apple Pages document
* pomodoro -- tiny console-based pomodoro timer
* youtube-mp3 -- not much more than a wrapper for youtube-dl's python module with easier user prompts
