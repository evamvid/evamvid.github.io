##Hi There!
#This is a list of some projects I plan to do in the future
* 3D Printer([Kossel Mini](http://reprap.org/wiki/Kossel))
* Hexapod Robot
* Kiwi/Honolomic Drive Robot
  * I also want to make a couple of these with thumbtacks and balloons so they can battle
* Knifemaking -- Check out how [Hackett](http://www.popsci.com/article/diy/how-i-used-paint-can-forge-rugged-knife-video?18xYfXeZ1TFg3M94.03) and [Will from Storm The Castle](http://www.stormthecastle.com/blacksmithing/blacksmithing-a-knife/knifemaking.htm) did it
